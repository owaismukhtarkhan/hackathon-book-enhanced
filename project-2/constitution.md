# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## 1. Purpose & Mission
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book is an educational platform designed to make advanced robotics and AI concepts accessible to absolute beginners. We bridge the gap between digital AI and physical systems through comprehensive, hands-on learning experiences.

## 2. Core Values
- **Accessibility**: All content must be understandable by beginners with minimal prior knowledge
- **Practicality**: Focus on hands-on learning with real-world applications
- **Innovation**: Leverage cutting-edge technologies like Google Gemini for VLA pipelines
- **Quality**: Maintain high educational standards and technical excellence

## 3. Technology Requirements
- **Framework**: Docusaurus v3 for documentation
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (no OpenAI per constitutional requirement)
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Python
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (https://www.better-auth.com/)
- **RAG System**: OpenRouter API with deepseek-chat-v3:free, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, Qdrant Cloud
- **Localization**: Urdu language support with translation capabilities

## 4. Educational Philosophy
