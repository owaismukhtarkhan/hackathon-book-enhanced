## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book implementation with 60 specific tasks organized across 7 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Docusaurus project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks) - Core infrastructure
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Physical AI Content (9 tasks) - P1 priority
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Simulation Environment (8 tasks) - P2 priority
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - AI Integration (8 tasks) - P3 priority
- Phase 6: Capstone Project (6 tasks) - P1 priority
- Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting (19 tasks) - Final improvements

All tasks follow required format with IDs, parallel markers, story labels, and file paths. Constitution compliance verified (TypeScript, Docusaurus, Purple+Neon theme, Google Gemini).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation roadmap with executable tasks
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/01-physical-ai-book/tasks.md created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user stories enabling independent development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow required format and align with design docs
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks
