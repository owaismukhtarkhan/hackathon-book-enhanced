## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Completed planning phase for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book feature, generating:

- Implementation plan with constitution compliance check
- Research document resolving all technical unknowns
- Data model defining curriculum entities and relationships
- Quickstart guide for students and developers
- Content API contract for educational materials

All artifacts comply with project constitution requiring TypeScript, Docusaurus, Purple+Neon theme, and Google Gemini for AI APIs.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete architecture and design artifacts created for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Multiple planning artifacts generated in specs/01-physical-ai-book/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation (/sp.tasks) and implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Architecture aligns with constitutional requirements and functional specs

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All planning phases completed successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate implementation tasks
