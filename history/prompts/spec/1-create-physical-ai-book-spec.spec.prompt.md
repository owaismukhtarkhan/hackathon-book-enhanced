## Prompt

use D:\\GenAI\\gemini-cli\\hackathon\\hackathon-book\\sp.specify.md for this

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive feature specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book based on the provided sp.specify.md file. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering core learning objectives
- Functional requirements aligned with the original specification
- Measurable success criteria focused on student outcomes
- Edge cases for different student scenarios
- A completed quality checklist confirming the spec meets all requirements

The specification focuses on creating educational content for absolute beginners to learn Physical AI concepts, ROS 2 fundamentals, robot simulation, NVIDIA Isaac platform, and Vision-Language-Action pipelines.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete spec created for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book feature
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/01-physical-ai-book/spec.md and requirements checklist created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for clarification or planning phases
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec successfully captures the educational objectives from the original document
