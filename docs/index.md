# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome to the comprehensive educational resource for **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This book bridges the gap between digital AI and physical systems, focusing on **Embodied Intelligence**—AI that understands physics, perception, motion, and interaction rather than existing purely in digital environments.

## 📘 About This Book

This resource is designed for **absolute beginners** and prioritizes **production-grade implementation over theory**. You'll learn to apply AI knowledge to control **humanoid robots** in **simulated and real-world environments**.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this 13-week curriculum, you will be able to:

- Design Physical AI systems
- Simulate humanoid robots
- Deploy AI-driven robotic behavior
- Integrate perception, planning, and action pipelines

### 🧰 Technology Stack

This book covers the following core technologies:

- **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System)
- **Gazebo** (Physics Simulation)
- **Unity** (High-fidelity visualization)
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS**
- **Vision–Language–Action (VLA) pipelines**

### 📚 Course Structure

The book follows a progressive complexity structure:

- **Weeks 1–2**: Fundamentals
- **Weeks 3–10**: Core skills
- **Weeks 11–13**: Advanced integration

Each module builds upon the previous ones, ensuring you develop a solid foundation before advancing to more complex topics.

### 🤖 Capstone Project

The course culminates in "The Autonomous Humanoid" project where you'll implement a complete system that can:
1. Receive a voice command
2. Interpret intent via language model
3. Plan a sequence of actions
4. Navigate obstacles
5. Identify an object using computer vision
6. Manipulate or interact with the object

## 🚀 Getting Started

Begin with the [Physical AI Principles](modules/week-01-02-fundamentals/physical-ai-principles) module to establish your foundation in embodied intelligence concepts.
