# Physical AI Principles

## Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI to **Embodied Intelligence**—AI systems that understand and interact with the physical world. Unlike conventional AI that operates purely in digital environments, Physical AI systems must comprehend physics, perception, motion, and real-world interaction.

### The Digital Brain vs. Physical Body

The core challenge in Physical AI is bridging the gap between:

- The **digital brain** (AI models, planning, perception)
- The **physical body** (robots, sensors, actuators)

This integration requires AI systems to understand:
- Physical laws and constraints
- Sensor data from the real world
- Actuator responses and environmental feedback
- Safety and reliability in physical interactions

### Key Concepts in Physical AI

1. **Embodied Cognition**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
2. **Sensorimotor Integration**: Seamless coordination between sensing and acting
3. **Physical Reasoning**: Understanding how objects behave in 3D space
4. **Real-time Processing**: Making decisions under physical and temporal constraints

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional digital AI
- Explain the concept of embodied intelligence
- Identify key challenges in bridging digital AI with physical systems
- Recognize applications of Physical AI in robotics

## Target Audience

This module is designed for **absolute beginners** with minimal prior knowledge. We'll use step-by-step instructions and real implementations rather than abstract theory.

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Understanding of what AI is (no programming experience required yet)

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 4-6 hours

## What's Next

After mastering these foundational principles, you'll move on to understanding how these concepts are implemented in practice through ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) in the next module.
